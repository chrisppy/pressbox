## Clients (Home Manager)

Import `inputs.pressbox.homeManagerModules.default`:

```nix
{
  programs.pressbox = {
    enable = true;
    server = "https://pressbox.your-tailnet.ts.net";
  };
}
```

This writes `~/.config/pressbox/client.json` and installs `pressbox`. Pairing
saves the token to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/pressbox/token`; set `tokenFile` only to use
a token from somewhere else. Both clients read these files, so pairing one pairs
both.

Set `desktop.enable = true` to also install `pressbox-iced`, the desktop client,
and `tui.enable = false` to leave out the terminal one.

### pressbox (terminal client)

`pressbox [--server URL] [--token-file PATH] [--config PATH]`. Flags and the
`PRESSBOX_SERVER` / `PRESSBOX_TOKEN_FILE` environment variables override
`client.json`. `pressbox pair [--name NAME]` pairs this machine;
`pressbox approve [CODE] [--user U]` approves (or lists) other devices'
requests, and `pressbox whoami` shows the signed-in user and device.

| Key | Action |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `j` `k` / arrows | Move (scrolls in the reader) |
| `Enter` / `l` / `Tab` | Open feed → item list → reader |
| `Esc` / `h` | Back (clears a search first) |
| `/` | Search titles and text, including read items |
| `m` | Toggle read |
| `s` | Toggle star |
| `o` | Open in browser (marks read) |
| `A` | Mark the selected feed (or all feeds) read |
| `M` | Mark the selected item and all below it read |
| `u` | Cycle unread / all / read items |
| `r` / `R` | Reload from server / ask server to refetch |
| `p` | Play the episode (or pause / resume it) |
| `V` | Play the episode's video |
| `x` | Stop playing (saves where you were) |
| `,` / `.` | Back 10s / forward 30s |
| `[` / `]` | Previous / next chapter |
| `-` / `+` | Slower / faster |
| `t` | Show the episode's transcript (in the reader) |
| `a` | Add the episode to Up Next, or take it out |
| `n` | Play the episode next (first in Up Next) |
| `J` / `K` | Move the episode down / up (in Up Next) |
| `q` | Quit |

Podcast episodes (items with audio or video) are marked `♪` in the list, `◐`
once started and `▶` while playing. They play in [mpv](https://mpv.io), which
must be installed (or set `player` in `client.json`, or
`programs.pressbox.player` in Home Manager): audio plays in the background,
video in mpv's window. The line above the status shows the time, chapter and
speed. The position is saved on the server every 15 seconds, on pause and on
stop, so playing resumes where you left off on any client; an episode played to
the end (or stopped in its last 30 seconds) is marked read. Opening an episode
doesn't mark it read. The reader lists its chapters, the current one highlighted
while it plays, and `t` swaps the text for the transcript.

Up Next, under Starred in the feed list, is the queue of episodes to play next,
kept on the server so every client shares it. When an episode plays to the end,
the first one in Up Next starts, and finished episodes leave it. It needs a
pressboxd with a queue; with an older one it stays empty.

### pressbox-iced (desktop client)

A window with three panes: sources (Unread, All items, Starred, Up Next, tags
and feeds, with unread counts), the item list with search, and the article.
Opening an item marks it read. Its desktop entry is named "pressbox", and its
Wayland app ID is `pressbox-iced`, for window rules.

On a machine that isn't paired yet it asks for the server and a device name and
shows a code to approve, as `pressbox pair` does; it then saves the token where
the TUI looks, and writes `client.json` only if that has no server (so a file
Home Manager manages is left alone). The sidebar can approve another device's
code, ask the server to refetch every feed, and sign out, which deletes the
token.

| Key | Action |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `j` / `↓` | Next item |
| `k` / `↑` | Previous item |
| `s` | Toggle star |
| `m` | Toggle read |
| `o` | Open in browser |
| `p` / `Space` | Play the episode (or pause / resume it) |

| `x` | Stop playing |
| `,` / `.` | Back 10s / forward 30s |
| `[` / `]` | Previous / next chapter |
| `t` | Show the transcript |
| `a` | Add the episode to Up Next, or take it out |
| `n` | Play the episode next (first in Up Next) |
| `J` / `K` | Move the episode later / earlier in Up Next |
| `Esc` | Dismiss a message |

Podcast episodes are marked `♪` in the list (`◐` once started, `▶` while
playing), and their article has Play, Watch video and Transcript buttons, the
duration and season/episode, and the chapters. Audio plays in the background
through GStreamer; video plays above the article. A bar along the bottom shows
the episode and chapter, a progress slider, chapter and skip buttons, and the
speed (click to step through 1×, 1.25×, 1.5×, 1.75×, 2× and 0.75×, without
raising the pitch). While playing, clicking a chapter or a line of the
transcript jumps there, and the line being heard is highlighted.

The position is saved on the server every 15 seconds and on pause and stop, so
playback resumes where you left off on any client, and an episode played to the
end (or stopped in its last 30 seconds) is marked read. Opening an episode
doesn't mark it read.

Up Next, in the sidebar when the server has a queue, lists the episodes to play
next; an episode's article has Add to Up Next (or Remove) and Play next buttons,
and, in Up Next, ↑ and ↓ to reorder. When an episode plays to the end, the first
one in Up Next starts. The queue is kept on the server, so it is the same in
every client.

The player shows up in the system's media controls (MPRIS on Linux, Now Playing
on macOS), so media keys, headphone buttons and Birdland's bar can play, pause
and seek it; "next" and "previous" skip 30 seconds forward and 10 back.

Colors are [Birdland](https://github.com/red-oxide/base24-themes), and Birdland
Light when the system is in light mode.

### In the Birdland bar

[Birdland](https://github.com/red-oxide/birdland)'s bar, bullpen, has a `feeds`
module showing the unread count. Click opens `pressbox` in your terminal, right
click asks the server to fetch every feed, and new items send a notification. It
reads the same `client.json` and token as `pressbox`, so pairing the TUI is all
it needs:

```nix
programs.birdland.bullpen.layout.right = [ "feeds" "clock" ]; # among your modules
```

Its options (`programs.birdland.bullpen.feeds.command`, `interval` and
`notifications`) are in
[Birdland's configuration options](https://github.com/red-oxide/birdland/blob/master/docs/usage.md#configuration-options).
