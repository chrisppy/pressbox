## Pairing devices

Every client gets its own token, and only its SHA-256 is stored. To pair:

1. On the new client, start pairing: `pressbox pair`, or "Pair this device" in
   the Apple or Android app. It shows a code like `K7W-4QX`.
1. Approve it on the server with `sudo pressboxctl approve K7W-4QX --user anna`
   (`--user` is needed once there is more than one user), or from a client that
   is already paired: `pressbox approve K7W-4QX`, or Settings in the apps. A
   device approved from a client goes to that client's user; admins can name
   another (`pressbox approve CODE --user anna`, or the user field in the apps'
   Settings).
1. The client picks up its token on its own. Codes expire after ten minutes.

`pressboxctl devices` lists devices with their user and when each was last seen;
`pressboxctl revoke <name>` locks one out. For a client that cannot pair (a
script, say), `pressboxctl add-device <name> --user <user>` prints a token.
`pressbox whoami` shows which user and device a machine is signed in as, and the
server's version.

Anyone who can reach the server can ask to pair, so requests are limited: 3
waiting per client address and 50 in all. Behind a reverse proxy or
`tailscale serve`, every request comes from the proxy; set `behindProxy = true`
so the address the proxy puts in `X-Forwarded-For` counts instead. Leave it off
otherwise, since clients could then send any address they like.
